What is machine learning?
• Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the field of study that gives the

• Tom Mitchell (1997): A computer program is said to learn from experience
E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its
performance at tasks in T as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Two Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms
Classification Regression
Example of regression: housing price prediction
Given: a dataset that contains 𝑛𝑛 samples
(𝑥𝑥1, 𝑦𝑦1), (𝑥𝑥2, 𝑦𝑦2), . . . , (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛, 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛)
Price
Task: if a residence has x squares
feet, predict the price?
Square feet

Supervised Learning: More examples
x = raw pixels of the image y = bounding boxes
Russakovsky et al. 2015
Two Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms
Classification • the label is a discrete variable 𝑦𝑦 ∈ {1,2,3, . . . , 𝐾𝐾}
Regression
• the label is a continuous variable
𝑦𝑦 ∈ ℝ
Training Data for Supervised Learning
Training data is a collection of input instances to the
learning algorithm:
(𝑥𝑥1, 𝑦𝑦1), (𝑥𝑥2, 𝑦𝑦2), (𝑥𝑥3, 𝑦𝑦3), . . . , (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛, 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛)
input
label
The training data is the “experience” given to a learning algorithm
Goal of Supervised Learning
Given training data
(𝑥𝑥1, 𝑦𝑦1), (𝑥𝑥2, 𝑦𝑦2), (𝑥𝑥3, 𝑦𝑦3), . . . , (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛, 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛)
Learn a function mapping 𝑓𝑓: 𝑋𝑋 → 𝑌𝑌, such that 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)
predicts the label 𝑦𝑦 on future data 𝑥𝑥 (not in training data)
Goal of Supervised Learning
Training set error
• 0-1 loss for classification ℓ=
𝑛𝑛
1
𝑛𝑛 ∑
(𝑓𝑓(𝐱𝐱𝑖𝑖) ≠ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖)
𝑖𝑖=1
𝑛𝑛
1
• Squared loss for regression: ℓ=
𝑛𝑛 ∑
(𝑓𝑓(𝐱𝐱𝑖𝑖)− 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖)2
𝑖𝑖=1
A learning algorithm optimizes the training objective
Details in upcoming
lectures :)
𝑓𝑓∗
= argmin 𝔼𝔼(𝑥𝑥,𝑦𝑦)ℓ(𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥), 𝑦𝑦)

Unsupervised Learning
• Given: dataset contains no label
𝑥𝑥1, 𝑥𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛• Goal: discover interesting patterns and structures in the data

intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity

Clustering
Clustering Irises using three different features
The colors represent clusters identified by the algorithm, not y’s provided as input
Clustering
• You probably have >1000 digital photos stored on your phone
• After this class you will be able to organize them better
(based on visual similarity)
Clustering Genes
Clustering Words with Similar Meanings
[Arora-Li-Liang-Ma-Risteski, TACL’17,18]
How do we perform clustering?
Many clustering algorithms.
We will look at the two most frequently used ones:
• K-means clustering: we specify the desired number of
clusters, and use an iterative algorithm to find them
• Hierarchical clustering: we build a binary tree over the
dataset

Part III: Reinforcement Learning
(Learning from rewards)
Reinforcement Learning
• Given: an agent that can take actions and a reward function
specifying how good an action is.
• Goal: learn to choose actions that maximize future reward
total.
Google Deepmind
1. 2. Reinforcement Learning Key Problems
Problem: actions may have delayed effects.
• Requires credit-assignment
Problem: maximal reward action is unknown
• Exploration-exploitation trade-off
“..the problem [exploration-exploitation] was
proposed [by British scientist] to be dropped
over Germany so that German scientists
could also waste their time on it.”
