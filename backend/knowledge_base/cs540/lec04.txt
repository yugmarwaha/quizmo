Logic & AI
Why are we studying logic?
• Traditional approach to AI (’50s-
’80s)
–
“Symbolic AI”
– The Logic Theorist – 1956
• Proved a bunch of theorems!
• Logic also the language of:
– Knowledge rep., databases, etc.
Symbolic vs Connectionist
Rival approach: connectionist
• Probabilistic models
• Neural networks
• Extremely popular last 20
years
Stanford CS231n
M. Minsky
Symbolic vs Connectionist
Which is better?
• Future: combination; best-of-both-
worlds.
– “Neurosymbolic AI”
– Example: Markov Logic Networks
Outline
• Introduction to logic
– Arguments, validity, soundness
• Propositional logic
– Sentences, semantics, inference
• First order logic (FOL)
– Predicates, objects, formulas, quantifiers
Basic Logic
• Arguments, premises, conclusions
– Argument: a set of sentences (premises) + a
sentence (a conclusion)
– Validity: argument is valid iff it’s necessary that
if all premises are true, the conclusion is true
– Soundness: argument is sound iff valid &
premises true
– Entailment: when valid arg., premises entail
conclusion
Propositional Logic Basics
Logic Vocabulary:
• Sentences, symbols, connectives, parentheses
– Symbols: P, Q, R, … (atomic sentences)
– Connectives:
∧ and [conjunction]
∨ or [disjunction]
⇒ implies [implication]
⇔ is equivalent [biconditional]
¬ not [negation]
– Literal: P or negation ¬P
Propositional Logic Basics
Examples:
• (P ∨ Q) ⇒ S
– “If it is cold or it is raining, then I need a jacket”
• Q ⇒ P
– “If it is raining, then it is cold”
• ¬R
– “It is not hot”
Propositional Logic Basics
Several rules in place
• Precedence: ¬
, ∧, ∨, ⇒, ⇔
• Use parentheses when needed
• Sentences: well-formed or not
well-formed:
– P ⇒ Q ⇒ S not well-formed (not
associative!)
Sentences & Semantics
• Sentences: built up from symbols with connectives
- Interpretation: assigning True / False
to symbols (a row in truth table)
- Semantics: interpretations for which
sentence evaluates to True
- Model: (of a set of sentences)
interpretation for which all sentences
are True
Another kind of model :)
Evaluating a Sentence
• Example:
• Note:
– If P is false, P ⇒ Q is true regardless of Q (“5 is even implies 6
is odd” is True!)
– Causality not needed: “5 is odd implies the Sun is a star” is
True!)
Evaluating a Sentence: Truth Table
• Ex:
P Q R¬P Q∧R¬P∨Q∧R¬P∨Q∧R⇒Q
0 0 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
• Satisfiable
– There exists some interpretation where the sentence is
true.

Q 1.1: Suppose P is false, Q is true, and R is true. Does this assignment
satisfy
(i) (ii) ¬(¬p → ¬q) ∧ r
(¬p ∨ ¬q) → (p ∨ ¬r)
Plug interpretation into each
sentence.
• A. Both
• B. Neither
• C. Just (i)
• D. Just (ii)
For (i): (¬p → ¬q) will be false so
¬(¬p → ¬q) will be true and r is true
by assignment.
For (ii): (¬p ∨ ¬q) is true and (p ∨ ¬r)
is false which makes the implication
false.

Knowledge Bases
• Knowledge Base (KB): A set of sentences {A1, …, An}
– Like a long sentence, connect with conjunction
– KB: A1 ∧ A2 ∧ … ∧ An
Model of a KB: interpretations
where all sentences are True
Goal: inference to discover new
sentences
Entailment
Entailment: a sentence B logically follows from A
• Write A ⊨ B
• A ⊨ B iff in every interpretation where A is true, B is
also true All interpretations
B is true
A is true
Inference
• Given a set of sentences (a KB), logical inference
creates new sentences
– Compare to prob. inference!
• Challenges:
– Soundness
– Completeness
– Efficiency
Methods of Inference: 1. Enumeration
• Enumerate all interpretations;
look at the truth table
–
“Model checking”
• Downside: 2n interpretations
for n symbols
Wiki
Methods of Inference: 2. Using Rules
• Modus Ponens: (A ⇒ B, A) ⊨ B
• And-elimination
• Other rules on the next page
– Commutativity, associativity, de Morgan’s laws,
distribution for conjunction/disjunction
Logical equivalences
You can use these equivalences to modify sentences.
Methods of Inference: 3. Resolution
• Convert to special form and use a single rule
• Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
(¬A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (¬C ∨ A)
a clause
Conjunction of clauses; each clause disjunction of literals
• Simple rules for converting to CNF
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
(¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ∧ (¬P1,2 ∨ B1,1) ∧ (¬P2,1 ∨ B1,1)
– Replace all ⇔ using biconditional elimination
– Replace all ⇒ using implication elimination
– Move all negations inward using
-double-negation elimination
-de Morgan's rule
– Apply distributivity of ∨ over ∧
Convert example sentence into CNF
B1,1 ⇔ (P1,2 ∨ P2,1) starting sentence
(B1,1 ⇒ (P1,2 ∨ P2,1)) ∧ ((P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ⇒ B1,1 )
biconditional elimination
(¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ∧ (¬(P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ∨ B1,1 )
implication elimination
(¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ∧ ((¬P1,2 ∧ ¬P2,1) ∨ B1,1 )
move negations inward
(¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1) ∧ (¬P1,2 ∨ B1,1) ∧ (¬P2,1 ∨ B1,1)
distribute ∨ over ∧
Resolution Steps
• Given KB and β (query)
• Add ¬ β to KB, show this leads to empty
(False. Proof by contradiction)
• Everything needs to be in CNF
• Example KB:
– B1,1 ⇔ (P1,2 ∨ P2,1)
– ¬B1,1
• Example query:¬P1,2
Resolution Preprocessing
• Add ¬ β to KB, convert to CNF:
a1: (¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1)
a2: (¬P1,2 ∨ B1,1)
a3: (¬P2,1 ∨ B1,1)
b: ¬B1,1
c: P1,2
• Want to reach goal: empty
Resolution
• Take any two clauses where one
contains some symbol, and the other
contains its complement (negative)
P∨Q∨R ¬Q∨S∨T
• Merge (resolve) them, throw away the
symbol and its complement
P∨R∨S∨T
• If two clauses resolve and there’s no
symbol left, you have reached empty
(False). KB |= β
• If no new clauses can be added, KB does
not entail β
Resolution Example
a1: (¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1)
a2: (¬P1,2 ∨ B1,1)
a3: (¬P2,1 ∨ B1,1)
b: ¬B1,1
c: P1,2
Resolution Example
a1: (¬B1,1 ∨ P1,2 ∨ P2,1)
a2: (¬P1,2 ∨ B1,1)
a3: (¬P2,1 ∨ B1,1)
b: ¬B1,1
c: P1,2
Step 1: resolve a2, c: B1,1
Step 2: resolve above and b: empty

First Order Logic (FOL)
Propositional logic has some limitations
• Ex: how to say “all squares have four sides”
• No context, hard to generalize; express facts
FOL is a more expressive logic; works over
• Facts, Objects, Relations, Functions
First Order Logic Syntax
• Term: an object in the world
– Constant: Alice, 2, Madison, Green, …
– Variables: x, y, a, b, c, …
– Function(term1, …, termn)
• Sqrt(9), Distance(Madison, Chicago)
• Maps one or more objects to another object
• Can refer to an unnamed object: LeftLeg(John)
• Represents a user defined functional relation
• A ground term is a term without variables.
• Constants or functions of constants
FOL Syntax
• Atom: smallest T/F expression
– Predicate(term1, …, termn)
• Teacher(Jerry, you), Bigger(sqrt(2), x)
• Convention: read “Jerry (is)Teacher(of) you”
• Maps one or more objects to a truth value
• Represents a user defined relation
– term1 = term2
• Radius(Earth)=6400km, 1=2
• Represents the equality relation when two terms refer to the
same object
FOL Syntax
• Sentence: T/F expression
- Atom
- Complex sentence using connectives: ∧ ∨ ¬ ⇒ ⇔
• Less(x,22) ∧ Less(y,33)
- Complex sentence using quantifiers ∀, ∃
• Sentences are evaluated under an interpretation
– Which objects are referred to by constant symbols
– Which objects are referred to by function symbols
– What subsets defines the predicates
FOL Quantifiers
• Universal quantifier: ∀
• Sentence is true for all values of x in the domain of
variable x.
• Main connective typically is ⇒
– Forms if-then rules
–
“all humans are mammals”
∀x human(x)⇒ mammal(x)
– Means if x is a human, then x is a mammal
FOL Quantifiers
• Existential quantifier: ∃
• Sentence is true for some value of x in the domain
of variable x.
• Main connective typically is ∧
–
“some humans are male”
∃x human(x) ∧ male(x)
–Means there is an x who is a human and is a male
