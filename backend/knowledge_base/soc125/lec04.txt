Clarifying “rent”
• We defined informally as “unearned returns”
• Economic rent,*any payment in excess of the
cost of production (Wikipedia)
* In economics, economic rent is any payment to the owner of
a factor of production in excess of the costs needed to bring that
factor into production. In classical economics, economic rent is
any payment made (including imputed value) or benefit received
for non-produced inputs such as location (land) and for assets
formed by creating official privilege over natural opportunities
(e.g., patents)... [E]conomic rent is distinct from producer
surplus, or normal profit, both of which are theorized to involve
productive human action.

Consumerism
Some terms
Consumption – purchase and use of something,
usually priced goods or services
Consumerism – a belief, with associated practice,
that one’s personal well-being, happiness and status
depend largely on one’s level and kind of
consumption of such things
Hyper-consumerism – exaggerated and often
frenetic (often dysfunctional, self-defeating, misery-
making, etc.) exercise of consumerism (“shop ’til
you drop,” Black Fridays, etc. etc.)
1. There are big negative externalities from consumerism
2. If happiness the goal, not a great way to get there
3. Weirdly enough, also violates consumer sovereignty and
thus even allocatively efficient use of resources. There are
systematic biases in the system which generate
consumerism.
4. If these system-biases were eliminated, many – maybe
most – people would adopt a less consumerist lifestyle.
That’s a problem for market fundamentalists because it
suggests that consumerism doesn’t reflect free choice.
What’s wrong with consumerism?

System bias #3:
Changing reference group for
consumption norms
Keeping up with the Jones
People sensitive to “positional” inequality
(Another reason to measure poverty in relative
terms)
As inequality increases, feel worse and over-
consume
This gets worse as above-average wealth suggested
as the norm, e.g., via media
Alone at home
• People do less that gets them out of themselves, either in
play or learning or service
• People have less regular contact with close friends
• People do fewer things with other people
• Secondary associations of almost all kinds are in decline
(unions, churches, etc.)
• Block parties as special events
• Public consumption generally pretty anonymous
• Privatized domestic consumption – TV!

Market fundamentalism program
• Deregulate
• Cut corporate and other taxes on the rich
• Pay for it through decreased social expenditures (aka
“austerity”)
• Privatize public goods (recreation, education,
transportation, public safety, etc.)
• Encourage private debt, and make money off it
• All of which leads to a lot of inequality, envy, and anger
• Consumerism feeds this by encouraging people to think
they’ve gotta buy more stuff to get the stuff they really
want (love, forgiveness, respect, self-respect, purpose,
competence)
Scarcity ≠ Quality
Health Care
Extraordinary value of the service
Ethical issues in distribution: some rationing process
is inevitable
Information costs for average consumer
The problem of preventive medicine: The market for
health vs. the market for treatment
Supply generates demand
Competition between providers leads to over-
investment
Distinctiveness of health care, as a commodity
• Extremely complex
• Pretty confusing and incentives often contradictory
• Most expensive in the world, by far
• Heavily rationed by price
• Fee for service, with minimal concern with
prevention
• Much worse health results than other rich countries
The US System
The logic of ObamaRomneyCare
Community Rating - Suppose you want preexisting
conditions covered. Then you have to impose community
rating — insurers must offer the same policies to people
regardless of medical history.
Mandate - But just doing that causes a death spiral in
insurance costs, because people wait until they’re sick to
buy insurance. So you also have to have a mandate,
requiring healthy people to join the risk pool.
Subsidies - And to make buying insurance possible for people
with lower incomes, you have to have subsidies
A moral hazard = a situation in which there is no incentive
to worry about costs since someone else is paying the bill.
Moral hazard in healthcare = If you have insurance, you
will tend to overuse medical services since you do not have
to pay each time you go to the doctor. This has the effect of
imposing costs on others.
Solution to alleged problem in healthcare = Rely on the
market and competition – enforced by an actuarial not
social model of reasonable allocation of risk – to force
down prices and enforce personal responsibility through
co-pays and other charges.
The “moral hazard” problem
Why ACA wanted a mandate
1. Insurance companies make money by selling insurance to people
who are healthy. This means:
2. They increase their profits by refusing to insure people with existing
health problem and by refusing to renew insurance once a person
gets sick.
3. To guarantee universal access to insurance, these practices have to
be prevented. Insurance companies have to be prevented from
refusing insurance because of pre-existing conditions.
4. But to keep private for-profit insurance companies healthy, you’re
got to expand the pool of healthy individuals who buy it. Otherwise
they will wait until they get sick. That’ll drive up costs for everyone
else, leaving more and more to leave the system, and eventually
eliminate profits.
So, if you want (a) maintain a private system and (b) guarantee
universal access, you’ve got to (c) require all people to buy insurance
and (d) subsidize those that can’t afford it – which is what ACA tried to
do

• Get incentives aligned: health rather than treatment
of illness; improvement rather than stasis
• Economies of scale in needed inputs (e.g., drugs)
• Learning on process as well as basic research
• Use data better
How to get better on health care
Reasons for higher average quality in VA
1. Economies of scale
2. Ability to buy drugs at a reduced cost by
negotiating discounts
3. Incentives for investing in quality
4. Strong incentives for preventive medicine
because of the life-time link to the patient
5. Efficient medical record and information
systems and health monitoring because of this
life-time connection
Canadian System
1. Universal
2. Comprehensive
3. Portable
4. Accessible
5. Publicly administered
6. Diversity in organization of actual delivery: single doctor
practice; community clinics; group practices; public
hospitals and clinics
7. Big Irony: In Canada there is universal public provision of
insurance for everyone, but greater freedom of choice by
patients and less bureaucratic hassle for doctors
Why doesn’t the US get more efficient?
Power and opposition of insurance companies
Power and opposition of pharmaceutical companies
Fee for service rather than results
Defensive medicine
Market ideology
Massive misinformation
Some public resistance to change
Ten tips for better health
1. Don't smoke. If you can, stop. If you can’t, smoke less
2. Follow a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and
vegetables
3. Keep physically active
4. Manage stress by, for example, talking things through
and making time to relax
5. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation
6. Cover up in the sun, and protect children from sunburn
7. Practice safer sex
8. Take up cancer screening opportunities
9. Drive safely
10. Learn the First Aid ABC : airways, breathing, circulation
Another ten tips
1. Don't be poor. If you can, get rich. If you can't, try not to be
poor for long
2. Avoid having poor parents
3. Own a car
4. Don't work in a high-stress, low-paid, or manual job
5. Don't live in low-quality housing
6. Be able to afford to go on vacation and sunbathe carefully
7. Practice not losing your job and don’t lose it
8. Grab all public benefits you can if you are unemployed,
retired, sick, or disabled. Learn how to fill out long forms.
9. Don’t live near pollution
10. Don’t worry about poor relatives. It’ll only stress you out.
