Free market ideal
Political consequences of taking it seriously: classical liberalism
What’s wrong with that ideal
– Market imperfections and failures
– Collective action problems (PDs and FRPs)
Political consequences of recognizing that
PI (Patrick Intelligence)
• SPM (relative and absolute)
• Endogeneity/endogenous
• Keynes
• Evolution of “liberalism” as political entity
• Dynamic efficiency
Markets know best, not (1)
• Markets are optimally efficient only when precise
conditions of “completeness” hold: complete markets
(markets in everything, now and the future), complete
information (everyone must know everything, and
therefore the same as everyone else), complete
independence (no public goods, externalities, increasing
returns)
• When these conditions fail, which they inevitably do,
there’s a case for state intervention (Bad Godesberg:
“markets whenever possible, the state where necessary”)
the idea was twofold: (a) let markets do what they do well
(allocate private goods in those cases when private and
social benefits are the same) but (b) have the state
provide public goods, correct externalities, and regulate
monopolies due to increasing returns
Markets know best, not (2)
Of course, politicians and institutions may have the same
problem (Buchanan, public choice). Governments are riddled
with “special” interests of many kinds, all ordinarily self-
serving, and there’s no particular reason to believe that state
actors will do things better, and lots of reasons for suspicion
that they’ll do things worse.
Here lies the fundamental dilemma of economic liberalism,
identified by Richard Posner: “The economist recognizes that
government can do some things better that the free market
can do but he has no reason to believe that democratic
processes will keep government from exceeding the limits of
optimal intervention.”
Markets know best, not (3)
(Markets are incomplete because we know that we will be making
transactions in the future but cannot perform them all now; information is
imperfect because we do not know everything about the others with whom
we do business; information and preference are "endogenous" because we
learn about others—their preferences, capacities, and beliefs—by observing
their conduct in the market, and changing our prior beliefs in light of those
observations)
• Together, incomplete information and endogenous preferences mean that
the market can no longer do its magic. Supply may not equal demand
(even in equilibrium); prices do not uniquely summarize opportunity costs
and can even misinform; externalities result from most individual actions;
information is often asymmetric; market power is ubiquitous; and "rents"
abound.
• These are no longer "imperfections," correctable departures from a
perfect market, since there is no unique, ideal market out there to be
blemished. There simply lots of possible institutional arrangements, each
with different consequences for social welfare.
A Standoff, Inviting Citizen Deliberation
The inefficiencies originating from incomplete markets and
endogenous information are profound. As Joseph Stiglitz put it
bluntly: "Once information imperfections (and the fact that
markets are incomplete) are brought into the analysis, as surely
they must be, there is no presumption that markets are
efficient. (emphasis added) Absent that presumption, `the
standard neoclassical model,' the formal articulation of Adam
Smith's invisible hand, the contention that market economies
will ensure economic efficiency provides little guidance for the
choice of economic systems."
This is also huge!

Market Capitalism & The Environment
An old problem about our respect for nature
• Pagan religions commonly saw nature as divine, the
source of all we enjoyed on earth, worthy of care and
respect.
• The Abrahamic tradition introduced a radically different
concept. The earth was the creation of a monotheistic
God, who, after shaping it, ordered its inhabitants, in the
words of Genesis: “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish
the earth and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish
of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.”
• Basically, nature was to be dominated.
Environmental crises, going beyond the limits
Five basic reasons for environmental problems
1. Individual lack of concern for the environment &
free-riding
2. Negative externalities of private choices and
profit-making firms
3. Strategies of powerful actors (seeking rents for
bad things, pushing costs onto the weak)
4. Consumerism run amok
5. Free market ideology blocks solutions
Is the Anthropocene the last age?
• 8M BC-1780, CO2 in atmosphere was steady at (give or take 10
parts per million) ~ 280ppm
• This increased 35ppm over next 150 yrs (1930s), 15ppm over
next 40 yrs (1970s), 20ppm over next 20 (1990s), 40 over next
20, reaching 400 (2015)
• CO2 ppm is 424 today (9/14/25) co2-earth
• At present rates of growth, it should exceed 500 ppm in next 30
years
• Last time that happened was the Eocene period, 50 million
years ago, when sea levels were 300 feet higher than today.

The Basic Problem
• Nearly everyone sane agrees that we can’t go over a 2⁰ C,
which means stopping burning fossil fuels very soon
• Our remaining “carbon budget” – the amount of new
carbon we can emit while “likely” staying within that
limit, is 550 gigatons
• But 2,795 gigatons is what fossil fuel companies and
nations behave like them already have on hand, worth
$30T
• Think of 2⁰ C as your legal drinking limit, 0.08 blood-
alcohol level. Think of 550 the six pack of beer you might
consume and stay within the limit. And think of the 2,795
gigatons as the three 12-packs the fossil-fuel industry has
on the table, already opened and ready to pour.
Things to do about carbon emissions
1. Price carbon emissions, either through a carbon tax or a cap and trade or fee and
dividend system on emissions (if you want to be radical, allocate on a per cap basis)
2. Make a boatload of cheap clean energy available (at present, 4th Generation nuclear
probably the best bet, followed by solar/wind and then geothermal)
3. Promote efficiency through upwardly ratcheted efficiency standards for buildings,
transportation, appliances, industry, and other energy end users, and/or a set-and-
raise efficiency trading scheme
4. Invest heavily and longterm in basic research and R&D on clean energy and energy
efficiency technologies; involve the private sector and pay attention to
commercialization; share the research world-wide and create a energy patent
commons, remove dysfunctional “gridlock” IP claims blocking innovation
5. Support smart growth for all the world’s metro areas, with clean transportation
options, transit, integrated walking and biking, TOD (transit-oriented development),
complete streets, etc.
6. Build the smart grid and reward efficiency and clean use throughout; share this
technology too
7. Stop destroying available nature; regenerate; for extinct and terminal species, revive
and restore

What is a “Wedge”?
A “wedge” is a strategy to reduce carbon emissions that grows
in 50 years from zero to 1.0 GtC/yr. The strategy has already
been commercialized at scale somewhere.
1 GtC/yr
50 years
Total = 25 Gigatons carbon
Cumulatively, a wedge redirects the flow of 25 GtC in its first 50 years.
At $100/tC, that’s $2.5 trillion dollars
A “solution” to the CO2 problem should provide at least one wedge.

Take home
• We almost certainly need bring CO2 atmospheric levels
down, radically
• Delay in effect means doing things without immediate
payoff, which is a huge problem in motivating people
• Another problem is that certain people benefit greatly
from current emissions patterns. Companies and states
holding booked value carbon fuel reserves are prominent
among them (2795Gt, vs. our 550Gt “carbon budget”),
and they will fight hard to exhaust them
• This is not first a technical problem, but an almost uniquly
difficult political one
• Of course, we’re also polluting like crazy and destroying all
kinds of natural systems in more “real” time. But that’s
more ordinary (if also very daunting) politics.

Arundhati Roy – “most appropriate metaphor for the insanity of our times”
Another possible definition of insanity?
The microeconomics of climate policy debate
• There’s a 20-30-year lag on GHG increase and peak global
surface temperature effect. How to pull the future damage of
that into present policy debate? Charge now for producing
that future damage. But how much?
• Getting that price right requires knowing a couple of things
– First, what’s the marginal damage done per additional unit
(e.g., ton) of spewed carbon? We know a lot about that
now, though we’ll never know it precisely until we
experience it.
– Second, what are willing to pay now to prevent that
damage in the future? What is it worth to us today to
avoid further climate disruption later this century?
$1 next week for a hamburger today?
• In thinking about any economic decision (consume/invest,
buy/save), you want look at your opportunity cost – the gains
foregone by not choosing an alternative use of your
resources; your decision will also reveal time preference –
the degree to which you prefer present benefits (money
today) over future benefits (money in the future).
• Together, these things will lead you to discount the present
significance of future economic events. The rate at which the
economic significance of future costs/benefits declines over
time is called the “discount rate.”
Compounding discounts toward inaction
• What may seem like small differences at which the discount
rate is set make a big difference, the further out they’re applied
(the miracle of compounding).
• At a discount rate of 3%, it’s worth $382B today to avoid. At a
discount rate of 5%, it’s worth only $72B
Bottom line – Depending (1) how big you estimate the future
costs of climate disruption, and (2) how soon you estimate them
to arrive, but especially (3) how you estimate growth and interest
rates on safe investments between now and then (and therefore
your opportunity costs), which gives you a discount rate, you can
always argue that it’s economically irrational to spend much now
on climate mitigation– or even immoral!
Let’s say climate change
will cost us $5T ( $5,000,000,000,000) at the end of the century.

Positive externalities & ticket prices
1. Suppose: (a) the direct costs of a ride = $3, and (b) there is
some kind of negative externality = $1/ride
2. Then the true cost per ride = $4
3. To cover these costs, the ticket price should be $4, not $3.
4. Now suppose: (a) the direct costs of a ride = $3, and
(b) there is some kind of positive externality = $1/ride
5. Then the true cost per ride = $2
6. So, the ticket price should be only $2
7. But the transit company has spent $3 in direct costs to pay
for the ride.
8. Therefore the society has to somehow pay for the $1 of
value everyone receives to reimburse the transit company
for providing the ride.
Take-home on transportation
For the free market to enable people to make efficient
choices two things must be true:
1. There are no significant externalities – positive or
negative – to your individual choice: what you chose
does not affect other people.
2. The full range of feasible alternatives from which to
make your choices can itself be provided by the
market.
Present transportation system violates both. Huge
externalities, choices influenced by absence of alternative
(i.e., good, efficient, cheap, mass transit), market actors have
no incentive and little capacity to provide that alternative,
even though it’d be economically efficient to do so.
