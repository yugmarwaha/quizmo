(Benjamin) Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning
Learning objectives
• What the course is generally about
– Values examined
– Questions about them, and debates on their asking
and answer
– Thinking sociologically
– 10 big ideas
• How the course is administered
• Where the US sits in the world of developed
nations
INTRODUCTION
Some values
Freedom: the idea that members of the society should be able,
to the greatest degree possible, to live their lives as they wish
Prosperity: the idea that the society’s economy should generate
the highest possible standard of living
Efficiency: the idea that the economy should be maximally
precise in allocating product to needs and wants, and
maximally productive and conserving in its use of resources
Fairness: the idea that members of the society should equally
enjoy its benefits and burdens – in protection, opportunity,
reward to contribution
Democracy: the idea that public decisions should reflect the
collective will of equal citizens, not of powerful and privileged
elites, and be governed by law
Combining these Values
Shared prosperity/inclusive grouwth: high and rising living standards; with
benefits of increased productivity widely shared (through labor
compensation, private wealth, progressive public goods) and fair opportunity
to contribute to and receive a fair share
Democracy: an open-ended ideal of self-rule with equal respect, with
legitimate collective/government power (through elections, deliberation –
reason giving by reference to common good) that is “of ... by ... for the
people” and efficient (allocatively and dynamically)
Sustainability: living today in a way that doesn’t limit future welfare by being
maximally efficient and restorative in use of non-renewable resources and
minimally toxic
Three sorts of questions
Positive: What kind of society is America? What are
some of its peculiarities? How do societies of its kind,
and this particular society, really work, i.e., how can we
explain their, and its, outcomes?
Normative: In a comparative perspective, how does
American society perform on the values of freedom,
prosperity, efficiency, fairness, and democracy? How
might it do better? How can we become a more just
and productive society?
Analytic/Methodological: How do social scientists go
about answering these questions?
Positive: What kind of society is America? What are

Some dimensions on which societies vary
• Wealth
• Productivity
• Economic organization
• Distribution of economic reward to cooperation
• Formal political organization
• Organization outside formal politics
• Relative prominence of social institutions
• Gender relations
• Race relations
• Popular culture (particularly as it bears on power)
• Global integration
Areas of debate
• How are these best defined?
• How are they measured?
• What are similarities and differences across
societies? (& over time)
• What’s important and not? (& over time)
• How is the state of things best understood or
explained?
Normative: How acceptable is America’s current
performance on these values? How might we do
better? If we could do better, is the fact that we’re not
“unjust”?
Areas of debate
• What is really meant by each of these values?
• Are some more important than others?
• Are there important tradeoffs among them, and if
so, how should those be resolved?
• Do we really know how to improve performance?
Questions always to ask about any proposed reform
Would it be good? desirability
Can we do it? achievability
Would it be viable (self-reproducing), if
achieved? viability
Analytic/Methodological: How do social scientists go
about answering these questions?
Areas of debate
• How to you measure anything?
• What’s objective, a “fact”?
• What’s true? correspondence vs. coherence
• What does “knowing” X mean? Explanation
(erklaren) vs. understanding (verstehen)
• Types of explanation ... nomothetic covering laws,
statistical likelihood, etc.
• Varieties of method ... endless
• Facts and values
So those are our sorts questions
Positive: What kind of society is America? What are
some of its peculiarities? How do societies of its kind,
and this particular society, really work, i.e., how can we
explain their, and its, outcomes?
Normative: In a historical and comparative perspective,
how does American society perform on five values its
members widely believe their society should promote –
freedom, prosperity, efficiency, fairness, democracy?
How might it do better, in our time, in viable ways?
Analytic/Methodological: How do social scientists go
about answering these questions?
Thinking sociologically
Rules govern action, but action changes rules: The
myriad of actions we take as conscious, choosing
persons are governed by social rules, which our
actions help reproduce. These rules are backed by
power and enforced. They are almost never neutral
(i.e., they usually have winners and losers). They
come from diverse sources, appear in diverse forms,
and are often inconsistent. They change over time,
due to action by people. So our actions are rule-
governed, but also produce and transform the rules
that govern them.
(If you want those numbered ... )
1. Our myriad actions are governed by rules, and often
help reproduce them
2. These rules are backed by power and enforced
3. They are almost never neutral; they have winners
and losers
4. They come from diverse sources, appear in diverse
forms, and are often inconsistent
5. They frequently change, through the deliberate or
unintended consequences of people’s actions
6. So our actions are governed by rules, but actions by
people also produce and change those rules
10 big ideas in course
1. There are lots of viable alternatives (aka “TINA not!”).
2. The U.S. is a hyper-capitalist country
3. Markets are great tools, but have definite limits
4. Collective action problems (PDs and FRPs) are ubiquitous
5. Current levels of poverty and inequality are unnecessary
6. Revolutions of race and gender are still incomplete
7. Democracy in the U.S. is relatively weak
8. Militarism and imperialism are not sustainable
9. Internationalization (greater exchange of people, goods and
services, and even flows of capital) need not defeat national
democracy
10. U.S. society could do much better than it now does on the key
values we’re looking at – i.e., it could ensure its members more
freedom, prosperity, efficiency, and democracy

WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY IS THE
UNITED STATES?
What kind of a society?
1. Developed ... technologically advanced
2. Biggest economy, extraordinarily rich
3. Hyper-capitalist (giant corporations, weak working class
organization, small state, high economic inequality)
4. Increasingly, part of a global economy
5. Low-mobilization, business-dominated, liberal democratic
system
6. Heavily militarized
7. Culturally & ethnically heterogeneous, but racially divided
8. Eroding male domination
9. Very violent place with a big prison/jail/etc. operation
10. Anomalously religious
1. Developed ... technologically advanced
1780’s: U.S. Not fully capitalist: 2/3 or more of the Northern
labor force was self-employed (mostly farmers); a majority of
labor force in much of the South were slaves
1870’s: a bit less than half of the population was probably self-
employed.; slavery was abolished, and the development of a
class of industrial employees was well on the way
1930’s: at least 2/3 of the labor force work for wages, but most
adult women are not in the labor force
2000’s: only around 8-12% are self-employed (i.e., the vast
majority of the labor force are employees); women have
almost as high labor force participation as men.

3. Hyper-capitalist and unequal
1. Production is mostly for the market
2. Most enterprises are privately owned and run for
profit, giving their owners effective control over the
direction and largest share of investment in the
soceity
3. People who do not own enterprises generally make
their living by working for someone else, usually in
some privately owned firm
Capitalism is an economic system in which
Hyper-capitalism
A form of market capitalism with exceptionally
1) Powerful corporations
2) Weak worker organization
3) Relatively little public regulation of markets
4) Low taxation and public goods
5) Very high levels of economic inequality
Big corporations
• The top 10 U.S. Industrial corporations had a combined sales
in 2021 of $2.8 trillion. If these ten corporations were a
country, they’d be the 8th biggest economy in the world
• The top 500 firms are vastly outnumbered by the nearly 7
million smaller firm that provide most employment, but they
account for 2/3rds of GDP and just under 30 million jobs (out
of roughly 160 million)
Weak unions and worker protection
• US today: ≈10% of the non-farm labor force is unionized; in
Sweden, it’s almost 70%; in most EU countries, 20-50%; and
most countries have “extension laws,” generalizing bargaining
results, but these are largely absent in the U.S.
• U.S. workers have far fewer workplace rights than in most other
developed countries. E.g.,
– Rights to paid parental leave
In Germany, mothers get 14 weeks maternity leave at
100% of wages; in France, 16 weeks for first 2 children and
26 weeks for subsequent children at 100% wages; in
Sweden, mothers and fathers share 15 months; in US, none
– Right to strike very limited
Only in U.S. can an employer higher permanent
replacements in a legal strike
– Mandated vacation time, rights to retraining
Standard in other countries; absent in U.S.

High inequality
• The US has the highest levels of inequality of all
developed economies
• Income equality has gotten much worse over the past
45 years, share of top 1% has gone from 9 to 24%
• Wealth inequality never good, but has also gotten
considerably worse, 1% share now above 40%
• Meanwhile, middle class eroding, a third of the labor
force earning poverty wages, and 20% of children are
left in life-killing poverty conditions (after taxes and
transfers)

The Gini coefficient
The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area that lies between the line of equality and the Lorenz
curve (marked 'A' in the diagram) over the total area under the line of equality (the sum of 'A'
and 'B' in the diagram); i.e., G=A/(A+B). The Gini coefficient can range from 0 to 1; it is
sometimes multiplied by 100 to range between 0 and 100. A low Gini coefficient indicates a
more equal distribution, with 0 corresponding to complete equality, while higher Gini
coefficients indicate more unequal distribution, with 1 corresponding to complete inequality.

4. Increasingly, part of a global economy
Trade:
– From WWI to the 1960’s US imports plus exports equaled
about 10% of GNP
– This roughly doubled in the 1970s and, today is more than
25% of GDP
– A very large share (≥ 50%) of U.S. multinational profits
come from operations abroad
Production is increasingly a “global factory,” with parts sourced
from all over the world, enabled by telecommunications
revolution, transportation revolution, doubling of world labor
force
Capital flows even more important than trade: risks to
interdependence evident in post-Lehman collapse

5. Low mobilization liberal democracy
1. Government power transferred by voters through
peaceful and regular elections of representatives to it
2. Citizens have civil rights and liberties that protect
them from government intrusion and enable political
and other association outside it
Liberal Democracy means a society in which
Some distinctive features of US system
1. Presidential (not parliamentary) system with “divided
powers” (separate powers assigned to legislative,
executive, and judicial branches)
2. Federal (not unitary) ... power divided between
national and state government; the first is limited,
the second effectively plenary; most power in states,
but states depend on feds for money
3. Winner-take-all, single-member-district elections
(not proportional to vote), with no opportunity for
plural nomination ... hence no viable third parties
Very low mobilization system
1. For long time, relatively weak parties ... candidate-
centered politics
2. Relatively porous ... increasing the importance of
organized interest groups and social movements;
never a democracy, more a “polyarchy” of elites
3. Money plays a huge role in politics, and business
dominates
4. Corporate-dominated media help define public
debate
5. Deeply depoliticized ... relatively low voting, low
knowledge of or interest in public affairs
This perfectly consistent with high polarization
Even lower in local elections
Concentrated influence of money
.05 percent give the max to any congressional candidate
.01 percent give more than $10,000 in a election cycle
.0000061 percent (196 people) account for 4/5ths of new super PAC money (circa July
2012)
Lessig 2012
.26 percent account for 68 percent of all contributions
Gilens 2012
But what if preferences diverge?
Low public trust in federal government
Common, widespread, popular delusions
Deluded about distribution of wealth
Deluded about “government handouts”
% beneficiaries who asserted independence of all government aid
Party Debt ClockSort of amusing, instructive, depressing
Deluded about recent history on this
Deluded about size of public employment
And where that government is
Deluded about ACA (aka “Obamacare”)
ACA passed in 2010 and there were official (GAO)
estimates about how much it would cost. Do you
think the government is spending is less than,
about the same, or more than what was
estimated?
Nastier partisan delusions
6. Highly militarized
• U.S. spends more on the military than the next ̴ 50 countries of
the world, combined, about 50 percent of global spending
• In 2003 – even before the Iraq War – we spent 13 times more
than China and over 20 times more than Russia on the military
• We have more soldiers around the world outside of our borders
than all other countries combined and our soldiers have fought
in more countries than any other country in the last half century
• In the last fifty years we have intervened militarily in scores of
conflicts and have been directly involved in trying to overthrow
at least a dozen governments
• Our economy has become deeply dependent upon military
spending ─ note that this is a distinctively non-capitalist, non-
free-market aspect of our economy
7. Ethnically heterogeneous, racially divided
• In a nation allegedly dedicated to the ideal of political
equality, genocide at settlement and after, brutal system
of chattel slavery only ended by our greatest war more
than two centuries later, racism institutionalized in U.S.
law (a great inspiration to Hitler) and still not rooted out
• There has been great progress, even post-emancipation.
But ... huge differences in education, income,
employment, health, incarceration compared to the
dwindling white majority
8. Eroding male domination
Women have made enormous progress in many social and economic
realms:
But there are still many things to accomplish. Still many “women’s”
occupations, lack of representation in elected office. Still significant
disparities in compensation, corporate power, household vision of labor.
