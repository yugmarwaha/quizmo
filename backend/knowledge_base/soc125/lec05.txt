Stepping Back
Odds & Ends (O&E)
• Nature and nurture aka genetic endowment and social
conditioning (restraints and support)
• Evolution (biological and cultural)
• A promise to say something next week on
– Neo-Darwinism, epigenetics, “evo-devo”
• 7 deadlies (PEGLAS) and 5 uglies (FDSDS)
• Fear and a particularly important motivation for a Pleistocene
brain fit for scarcity
• Economics in two stories
– The $10 bill that isn’t there
– The restaurant so crowded nobody goes anymore
Last Class Learning objectives
1. Understanding some of the many ways human
nature and market capitalism encourages
consumerism, and US hyper-capitalism hyper-
consumerism
2. Some of the consequences of that
3. How to improve that
4. Understanding some of the many ways market
capitalism, especially in the US, is dysfunctional
for health care
5. And ways to improve that.s to improve it
PI (Patrick Intelligence)
How were people still covered without it being
mandated?
How did insurance companies function re: being
able to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions,
or after people got really sick, before the ACA's
provisions?
Just fine. Made even more money!
They weren’t!
Anything else?Anything else?
Anything else?
Sure?
Really sure?
Stepping Forward
Learning Objectives for this Class
1. Understanding why finance is so important in
anthe economy and how the US financial system
works
2. Understanding recent financialization in US, its
often disastrous consequences, and how to
improve
3. Understanding the high-road approach to
development, what a high-road capitalism might
look like, and how pursuing it might vastly
improve things
4. Review of Section One: Market Capitalism
Finance
What’s in a word?
• Finance can be a beautiful or terrible thing
• As a field, it’s mostly about the terms under
which credit (money ability to do things) is
extended, which is shaped by the risk in doing
so
• The term “finance” comes from the Latin finis,
meaning “end” or “complete accounting” or
“goal”
Some basic concepts
• Money
• Fiat currency
• Credit
• Debt/leverage
• Reserve requirements
• Capital (equity)
requirement
• Investment
• Capital gains
• Securities
• Speculation
• Assets
• Bubbles
• Balance sheet recession
• Inflation disinflation
• Deflation
Banks
• A key idea: how do banks “create” money (“loanable funds”
or “bankers’ money”/“licensed franchisee”)
• A problem: inherent risks in loans
• Banking panics: a run on the bank
• Solution: deposit insurance + regulation
• Investment banks vs. commercial banks
• Bank speculation & Financial Crisis
• Core solution in the 1930s: Glass-Steagall Act separating
commercial and investment banking
• Recurring crisis absent regulation and democracy to steer it

Growth in debt derivatives
Collateralized debt obligation – a complex finance
product that is backed by a pool of loans and other
assets. These underlying assets serve as collateral if the
loan goes into default.
Credit default swap – a financial derivative that
allows an investor to swap or offset their credit
risk with that of another investor. To swap the risk
of default, the lender buys a CDS from another
investor who agrees to reimburse them if the
borrower defaults.

Housing Bubble
• Changes in the mortgage market – ARMs (adjustable rate
mortgages), mortgage-backed securities derivatives, weak
oversight of underwriting practices – fueled heavy investment
in housing, and securities of little little value
• Investment banks got heavily into the securities end of this
market, usually leveraging heavily to do so
• When prices started declining, the whole structure unraveled,
beginning with Lehman Brothers
• Bailout needed to prevent total financial system collapse

How to Fix our Financial System?
• Restore the Glass-Steagall distinction between investment
and commercial banks and/or playing with other people’s
(e.g., depositors’) money
• Strengthen and enforce Dodd-Frank regulations
• End “too-big-to-fail” by breaking up or truly regulating the
Monster Banks, and the “shadow banks”
• Build a more community-rooted financial system
• End the revolving door, pay-to-play, serve-to-lobby, and
corrupt campaign finance system to get some accountability
to the people
• Recognize credit as a risk, and discourage excess formation

3. Weak labor
4. Rising labor market insecurity
Getting to living wage jobs requires
• Entry-level employment that prepares workers for and connects them to
future opportunities
• Reliable and understood methods of access to decent paying sectors &
jobs
• Routine career advancement through incremental moves
But today that’s very hard given
• Deregulation, privatization, de-unionization
• Changes in work organization — outsourcing, contingent/temporary work,
cellular production, etc. — in smaller establishments, generally in service
sector
• End of job ladders, employer-based welfare state, industry wage norms
• Automation, AI, “end of work”

6. Environmental crisis (catastrophe?)
The end of the Anthropocene?
• 8M BC-1780, CO2 in atmosphere was steady at (give or take 10 parts
per million) ~ 280ppm
• This increased 35ppm over next 150 yrs (1930s), 15ppm over next 40
yrs (1970s), 20ppm over next 20 (1990s), 20ppm over next ten (2005),
close to 30 over next
• CO2 ppm is 415.33 (10/8/22)
• At present rates of growth, it should reach 500 ppm before mid-
century
• Last time that happened was the Eocene period, 50 million years ago,
when sea levels were 300 feet higher than today.
• Global warming already associated with massive ice sheet melting,
extreme weather, widespread drought, population migration
7. Fiscal exceptionalism
8. Financialization
9. Polarized politics
• Incomes rise, investment moves out
• Revenues decline
• Public goods deteriorate
• Middle class flees
• Tax base erodes
• Poverty concentrates
10. Anti-urban bias in policy
Iron Law of Urban Decay
So, what should we do?
Need a strategy
What’s a (political) strategy?
Many things, but minimally it’s a plan of action with a defined
goal, clear and plausible incremental steps in getting there, with
progress in each step making the next one more likely (aka
“momentum”), and a basic message (interpretation) on reality
that makes sense of it.
What matters most is not where or how you start but that you
start, with shared clarity on aims and means. Some courage and
conviction help too. Anybody who says “ideas don’t matter” or
“people don’t care about making sense of reality” is no less an
elitist fool than someone who thinks “the best idea always wins,
even without people fighting for it.”
The Right’s political strategy
Goal ... end all social constraints on capital
Incremental steps ... deregulate business, demonize and
starve government, crush unions, regressively
redistribute income and wealth, etc.
Momentum ... each step increases material insecurity,
and reduces social capacity to relieve it
Basic message ... “You’re on our own (YOYO!), and
anybody who tells you different is a LIAR!”
What’s a democratic (NB: not
Democratic) counter to that?
Two ways of making money in this world
You can treat people like road kill, the earth like a
sewer, and democratic government as something to
weaken and mock, while you extract as many rents
from government’s remaining power as you can
Let’s call that the “low road”Or you can use democracy to add value, reduce
waste, and capture and share and the benefits of
doing both, locally
Let’s call that the “high road”Put America on the high road
Wealth – What makes a place rich?
A place’s wealth is finally determined by its productivity – its use
of its human, physical, and natural capital, and the ever-elusive
Solow residual of “multifactor productivity”
But productivity should be defined correctly. Productivity is a
function both of the value ($) of goods and services produced
and the efficiency of that production. Productivity shouldn’t be
measured as “output per hour” but value ($) per unit of input
And you should include all relevant factors of production in
calculating input and resulting value – human, physical, natural,
financial, social, etc., aka all-factors productivity
First premises
Values – What makes it worth fighting for?
Shared prosperity: high and rising living standards; with benefits
of increased productivity widely shared (through labor
compensation, private wealth, progressive public goods) and fair
opportunity to contribute to and receive those shares
Democracy: an open-ended ideal of self-rule, equal respect,
with legitimate collective/governemnt power (through elections,
deliberation, reason giving, by reference to common good) that
is “of ... by ... for the people” and efficient (allocative and
dynamic efficiency)
Sustainability: living today in a way that doesn’t limit future
welfare, maximally efficient and restorative in use of non-
renewable resources, minimally toxic, approximating zero waste
“Markets vs. States” doesn’t decide
• Markets are allocatively efficient when certain precise conditions hold:
complete markets (markets in everything, now and in the future), complete
information (everyone must know everything, and therefore the same as
everyone else), complete independence (no public goods, externalities,
endogenous preferences, increasing returns)
• When actual market stray from these conditions, there’s a clear case for
state intervention to restore optimality (SD: “markets whenever possible,
the state where necessary”)
• But politicians and institutions may have the same problem of self-serving
sub-optimality (Buchanan, public choice) and (Posner) there’s little reason to
believe that state action will end at improving market efficiency
• Even perfectly competitive markets provide no decisive “magic” guidance on
policy; ubiquitous externalities, information asymmetries and endogenous
preferences mean prices are often deranged and supply and demand meet
even at equilibrium; this is much more than corrigible “imperfections”
Invisible hand is invisible because it doesn’t exist — Stiglitz
Human nature
Homo reciprocans – combines strong reciprocity (in the tit-for-tat sense of
being, sequentially, nice, punishing, forgiving) with basic needs generosity (for
the “deserving”)
Homo economicus – relentless selfish optimizing toward outcomes
Zero Sum → Win-win or lose-loseRational calculator → Prudent approximatorIndividual ability → Group cohesionCompetition → Cooperation
As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that
the future of the human race requires the cooperation
of its members
Occupy Wall Street
People who work together will win,
whether it be against complex football
defenses, or the problems of modern
society.
Vince Lombardi
Individual  Relational
Out of the crooked timber of
humanity, no straight thing was ever
made.
Immanuel Kant
Selfish → Reciprocal
It’s all about productive cooperation!
Unit of analysis: firms/establishments
Which industries a place competes/trades in is far less important
than how establishments/firms in those industries compete.
Firms disintegrated – Even in vertically integrated firms, as
measured either by total value dollar or weight, half of supplier
establishments ship nothing within the firm, the median ships
less than 0.1 percent, even at 90th percentile, they ship only 38%
Establishments differ – Better than 2/3rds (67.5%) of increase in
earnings inequality since ’92 explained by establishment
differences; across establishments, in all sectors, variance in
revenue also increasing. This result recently extended on a firm
basis to 16 OECD countries.

High road
“High road” denotes a (universally available and scalable) place-
based strategy (or family of strategies) to realize the fighting
values while increasing wealth under competitive market
conditions
Strategy is to use tools of democracy (in state and civil society) to
– Reduce waste (in people, technology, and environment)
– Add value (increase productivity, in the sense just defined)
– Capture and share the benefits of doing both, locally
– Repeat and extend, with experiment and learning (Or, via
Beckett : “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail
again. Fail better.”)
NB: On this view, democracy is another force of production – an
engine of wealth creation, not just legitimacy and fairness
Democracy as a force of production?
Along with satisfying demands for representation and equal treatment,
democratic institutions/practices increase wealth beyond private law
“rule-setting”
– They increase market efficiency by correcting market failures and
imperfections, often precedent to providing public goods
– By providing public goods, they can further increase social
efficiency and individual entrepreneurship
– By treating self-ruling citizens with equal respect, they induce
greater effort, voluntary monitoring, information revelation,
which increases productivity directly and increases social
problem-solving capacity, and more innovation
– Efficient public goods in places make density more attractive,
yielding positive network effects and external economies of
scale (aka “agglomeration effects”), increasing returns and yet
more innovation
Choice for firms/establishments

• Better trained and equipped workers
• Continuous improvement/innovation
• Approximation of “zero waste”
• Supportive policy and public goods
• Sweated labor, high insecurity
• Punitive HR, poisonous LR
• Low mobility, high inequality
• Environmental damage
• Little commitment to place
• Undemocratic, extractive elites • Higher income, security, mobility

Importance of place &“the wealth of networks”
To develop (or not) higher standards of performance and supports in meeting them.
To choose, or not (and this is a way of stating the high road policy agency) to close off
the low road, help pave the high road, enable those stuck on the first to roll merrily
along the second
Peer production networks — Of connected more easily by internet, peers can
jointly produce things in “open source” collaboration. Often the cost and
status reward of doing so leads people to do it for free (e.g. Wikipedia, Galaxy
Zoo). Its basic “crowdsourcing” idea can be extended to financing (e.g.,
Kickstarter, Prosper), advocacy (e.g., MoveOn, Avaaz, Change.org), and charity
(e.g., Kiva) with socially productive effects
“Backyard” growth strategies — Focusing first on your domestic productivity
and well-being, rather than first on exports
Internationalization of trade vs. finance — Second generally far more
dangerous than the first, because of speed of disruption, constraint on
domestic economic management, concentration of benefits, corruption of
politics
Economies of scale vs. scope — Decreasing marginal costs with greater
volume; increasing returns from more efficient sharing, greater connection,
joint production, “deeper” labor markets, etc. (again, organized density)
You can measure the high road
• Value-added / FTE ≥ 1.5 industry average
• Average non-supervisory wage ≥ 3 Federal Minimum Wage
• Nonsupervisory worker payroll + benefits ≥ 0.5 total value-added
• Computer use by ≥ 2/3rds of employees
• Employee turnover rate < 20% annually
• Etc. etc.
*
For establishments/firms
*
• Health, wealth, wages, savings, educational attainment, equality of
opportunity and outcome, presence and quality of public goods,
access to those goods, efficiency of consumption, accountability of
government, level and quality of citizen engagement
• Etc. etc.
... and for communities
It’s really not that hard to tell the
difference between a low- and
high-roading establishment/firm
or community (or region, state,
nation, or world).

Competitiveness
Worker organization and high-road capitalism
But is it feasible?
Is it possible to increase productivity
dramatically?
Does place still matter economically?Is there a significant amount of costly
waste that we know how to reduce?
Political feasibility will be decided by
our collective consciousness and
commitment and that’s impossible
to predict ...
Does it make economic sense?
Significant waste we know how to
reduce?

Could we really increase productivity
dramatically (and quickly)
How does productivity improvement
happen?
• New idea
• Testing of that idea
• Application of that idea
• Improvement in that application
• Incremental improvements, aka “process
improvement”
• Commitment to basic science, application, and
continuous process improvement
How can it happen very quickly?
• Either by getting the whole society committed
to what was just said
• Or by deliberately encouraging it
• Or both
Within-sector variation in productivity
An example from a PBS (Performance Benchmarking Survey) sample of Midwest metal-
stamping (NAICS 332116) establishments
Metal stamping is a manufacturing process where flat sheet
metal is formed into specific shapes using a stamping press and
dies (specialized tools).
• Here’s how it works. A piece of sheet metal (called a blank) is
placed between a die and a punch in a stamping press. When
the press applies force, the metal is cut, bent, or shaped into
the desired form. It's kind of like using a cookie cutter, but
with much more force and precision, and it can create
complex 3D shapes, not just flat cutouts
• Metal stamping is used to mass-produce parts like:
– Car body panels and brackets
– Electronic components and enclosures
– Appliance parts
– Metal cans
– Hinges and fasteners
Increasing productivity quickly
Value added per worker
ranges from $60K to > $400K
Does place still matter?
100 US Metros: 75 % of GDP
The world’s not flat, it’s spiky
Top 130 cities account for more than a third
Cities are the future
70% of WP by 2050
70% of world product on
<3% of world surface area,
<9 of land surface area
A program of action
Get smart and unapologetic about cities
• Incomes rise and investment moves out
• Revenues decline
• Public goods deteriorate
• Middle class flees
• Tax base erodes
• Poverty concentrates
An Iron Law of Urban Decay?
Or a wasting of obvious assets?
E.g.: size, location advantages, density, key infrastructure,
appeal for new industries, eds and meds foundation, more
skilled workers, younger workers, immigrants, key
infrastructure, greater energy efficiency, tax base for public
goods, political tolerance, higher wages and productivity,
more easily organized

If you build cities around cars and traffic ...
you get cars and traffic and sprawl
If you build cities around people ...
you get people
Getting started
1. Map your economy and offer a new deal to employers: “We’ll give
you almost anything to get you on the high road and almost nothing if
you want to stay on the low-road; in fact, we’re going to make it
harder, by raising performance standards (though we’ll help you meet
them)”
2. Build skills to meet demand for higher-value-adding work; reform
education system to be seamless, integrated, modularized, open,
lifelong, demand-driven; provide other services to meet higher
standards
3. Lower waste and reduce the cost of living by cutting energy, housing,
and transportation costs through smarter growth and public goods
4. Reform government to be cleaner, smarter (evidence-based, more
experimental), more accountable, more open-source in problem-
solving; with more engaged citizens throughout
5. Pay for it all by progressive taxes on the resulting increased income
and wealth, value capture on productive development, and Pigovian
taxes on public bads (pollution, sprawl), while spending nothing (zilch,
nada, zero! ) on things that don’t add to wealth and general welfare
Review
Summing up first section of 125
1) US a big, rich, technologically advanced, violent, racially divided,
anomalously religious, hyper-capitalist place, with a complex (and
increasing dysfunctional) liberal pluralist government
2) Markets are fantastic coordination mechanisms and great for negative
freedom. But market capitalism always generates objectionable
inequalities in positive freedom and, if left unguided, will cause
tremendously costly and unnecessary losses to human welfare. We’ve
seen this in everything from the environment and transportation to
consumerism and health care, and just saw it in finance and economic
development
3) Markets don’t work at all without rules that they can’t generate
themselves. The idea of a perfectly “self-regulating” market is as much a
myth as the idea that markets are always allocatively, much less
dynamically, efficient.
Summing up first section (cont.)
4) Markets’ most important institutional weakness is that they cannot solve
cooperation problems, on which solution they, and our survival as
organized life, depends. Market capitalism encourages exit and a norm
of strategically applied economic rationality, which erodes shared sense
of the reality of mutual dependence, much less community and shared
purpose. Markets greatly exacerbate PD (prisoners’ dilemma)-like
problems, including the FRP (free-rider problem), which are pervasive.
5) That’s basically why you need government or other democratic
organizations to save markets from themselves. But as you consider how
to do that through collective action (not just the state that acts in its
name), don’t be a fool. Markets are cool tools and often preferable to
other ways of making decisions. But they are also amoral and short-
sighted, so they shouldn’t be given society’s keys. And “market
fundamentalism” is a really horrible religion. (Remember your Blake!
And your [largely unread] Smith!)
